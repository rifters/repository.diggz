### **F.A.Q.**
**Where is my mouse pointer ?**
<br>Mouse usage is not supported in Bello and will never be.
<br>Please disable it from Settings > System > Input Devices > Enable mouse and touch screen support.

**I only see unwatched status indicators. Is there an option to display watched status indicators as well?**
<br>No, there isn't and will never be. There is an indicator if the item is unwatched. If there is no indicator, the item is watched. I find this obvious and logical, and thus feel there is no added value in placing an indicator on files that have been watched. 

**Can i play games using Bello ?. Is there any support for this ?**
<br>No and will never be. Why ?... because Kodi is not a games console and as surprising as it sounds to some people... i don't play games!

**Can you add the X or Y feature ?**
<br>Mostly...not. As much as i hope people will enjoy using Bello, development is also driven by my own preferences. Apart from that, i just have no motivation to add features i wouldn't ever use myself and most importantly, my free time these days is very limited and it's unlikely to find more time besides some bug fixing.

**Where is the X or Y feature from the old Bello? Can you add it back?**
<br>Well...if is not there then mostly i've removed it either because i didn't like it anymore, or because wasn't fit with the new style of Bello 6. And no... i wont add it back.

**It's been days that a i've posted a question/request/suggestion in the forum and still i don't have any answer. Are you ignoring me ?**
<br>Maybe yes, maybe not. I am pretty busy ATM with other stuff outside of Kodi so any help or explanations they might be delay. So if you couldn't get any help from other users please be patient!. Also any requests or suggestions whom i don't agree or like will be ignored. Sorry guys, but i don't have the time to answer no & why to all of these stuff.

**Where i can find support for this ?**
<br>[Bello forum at Kodi.tv community.](http://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=198)
